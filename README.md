# Alternate History Storytelling Website

This is a website created to document a campaign of Hearts of Iron 4 in the mod Kaiserreich:Legacy of the Weltkreig.

It's basically a historical retelling of an alternative version of World War 2 but written by a historian in said alternate universe.

## There are 4 pages in the website covering what happened between
- 1940 to 1944
- 1944 to 1948
- 1948 to 1951
  
### There is also a section on Peace Treaties to show the different changes in borders as the years went by.

## What was used to make this website
This website was made with React but not a lot of actual Javascript was used other than using jsx to format React components and BrowserRouter to make multiple pages. 

This project was mostly a project for me to learn how HTML and CSS works.

## Here are some images of the website

This is what the articles all look like, there is a sidebar that can scroll to the major events of each section.

This is the main page, the navbar at the top scrolls down to each sections.
