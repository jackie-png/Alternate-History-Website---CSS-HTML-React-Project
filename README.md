# Alternate History Website

This is a website created to document a game of Hearts of Iron 4 in the mod Kaiserreich.

It's basically a historical retelling of their version of World War 2 but it is a completely different version of the war from or POV.

## There are 4 pages in the website covering what happened between
- 1940 to 1944
- 1944 to 1948
- 1948 to 1951
- Peace Treaties

## What was used to make this website
This website was made with React but not a lot of actual Javascript was used other than using jsx to format React components. This project was mostly a project for me to learn how HTML and CSS works.

## Here are some images of the website
